    <p><img src="img/pressRelease/pressRelease.jpg" style="width:300px; float:left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;">AUSTIN, TEXAS   Lysts on the Lake is open to the public and will be held Friday May 11 through Sunday May 13 at the Taylor Rodeo Association's arena in Taylor, Texas.  Lysts on the Lake offers you the chance to witness the breathtaking spectacle of competitive jousting in the largest event held in the world today. Be a part of the action as trained equestrians, contesting their skill in one of medieval Europe's oldest athletic events, thunder along the tilt with the aim of establishing themselves in a position of rank amongst other jousting competitors throughout the world. This mounted challenge from the medieval age of chivalry is the ultimate test of equestrian skill and training.

    <p>Lysts on the Lake is neither a renaissance festival nor a dinner theater stunt show but an actual competitive sporting event featuring some of the finest horsemen and women trained in the medieval equestrian arts. The armor is real, the lances are real, the hits are real and the competition is real.

    <p>The three day event features not only competitive jousting, but a Skill at Arms competition on horseback, the Melee a'Cheval which consists of over 30 armored competitors fighting in a massive battle armed with tourney batons, demonstrations of Renaissance and Medieval fighting techniques on foot as well as a variety of food, beverages and arts and craft vendors.

    <p>Lysts on the Lake is a proud affiliate of the International Jousting League, which was created in 2004 to provide riders with a unique, competitive and safe environment to fit their passion for historical equestrian sports. Since then, the League has grown into the largest and most active jousting community in the modern world. The International Jousting League is made up of over 300 competitors from over 20 countries from around the world.
