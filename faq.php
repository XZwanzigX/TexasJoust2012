    <p><a name="22"><b>22. What is the International Jousting League (IJL)?</a><br>

    <p><a name="23"><b>23. Are all competitors at "Lysts on the Lake" members of the IJL?</a><br>
    Most, but not quite all, of the competitors are members of the IJL.

    <p><a name="24"><b>24. How are the competitors chosen?</a><br>
    "Lysts on the Lake" is an Open tournament, which means that anyone with the proper equipment and experience can compete.  However, all competitors must submit their application to participate during a specific application period.  If you missed out on this year's application period, keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.aplaisance.com/application.php" target="_blank">application site</a> for the opportunity to participate in next year's tournament.

    <p><a name="25"><b>25. Is this really a competition, or is it choreographed?</a><br>
    This is a real competition!  Nothing is choreographed.  "Lysts on the Lake" is a true sporting event. For an explanation of how the equestrian competitions work, check out the pages for the <a href="joust.php">Joust a'Plaisance</a>, <a href="joust.php">Melee a'Cheval</a>, and <a href="skillAtArms.php">Skill at Arms</a>.

    <p><a name="26"><b>26. How does the competition actually work?</a><br>
    Competitors will compete in three equestrian events, the <a href="joust.php">Joust</a>, <a href="joust.php">Melee a'Cheval</a> and <a href="skillAtArms.php">Skill at Arms</a>. There is also a competition for the Award of Honour which is based on how honourably competitors behave throughout the event.  Prizes will be awarded to the winners of each individual event, as well as the overall tournament champion.

    <p><a name="27"><b>27. Who won last year's "Lysts on the Lake"?</a><br>
    Last year, <a href="http://texasjoust.com/individualCompetitor.php?id=1">Steve Hemphill</a> won the Joust a'Plaisance.  The Melee a' Cheval was won by <a href="http://texasjoust.com/individualCompetitor.php?id=26">Dave Wise</a>, and <a href="http://texasjoust.com/individualCompetitor.php?id=13">Dustin Stephens</a> won the Skill at Arms and the Award of Honour.  The overall Champion for "Lysts on the Lake 2011" was Dustin Stephens.

    <p><a name="28"><b>28. How often do competitors get injured?</a><br>
    Due to the high level of training and armour standards, injuries to our competitors are fairly rare.

    <p><a name="29"><b>29. Can girls joust?</a><br>
    Absolutely!  "Lysts on the Lake 2012" will have 12 female competitors overall.  Seven plan to compete in the Joust a'Plaisance, six in the Melee a'Cheval and eleven in the Skill at Arms.

    <p><a name="30"><b>30. Where/how can I learn to joust?</a><br>
    If you are interested in learning to joust, you should check out the <a href="http://www.chivalricmartialartsinternational.com">Chivalric Martial Arts International</a> symposium, happening the week before Lysts.

    <p><a name="31"><b>31. What kind of horses do the competitors ride?</a><br>
    At this year's Lysts, the competitors will be riding horses of many different breeds, including Belgians, Percherons, Friesians,  Andalusians, American Quarter Horses, Paints and Thoroughbreds.

    <p><a name="32"><b>32. Do the horses have some kind of special training?</a><br>
    Yes!  Training a horse to Joust, run the Skill at Arms and fight in the Melee requires a significant amount of time and specialized practice.  To find out more about the training of the horses(and knights!) we invite you to consider attending the <a href="http://www.chivalricmartialartsinternational.com">Chivalric Martial Arts International</a> symposium.

    <p><a name="33"><b>33. How is "Lysts on the Lake" different from a renaissance faire?</a><br>
    Unlike many renaissance faires where the joust is usually a choreographed show, "Lysts on the Lake" is a genuine sporting event which is affiliated with the International Jousting League.  Each competitor’s score will be ranked with all the other jousting competitors in the IJL.

    <p><a name="34"><b>34. Can I volunteer to help?  Even if I don't have experience working with horses?</a><br>
    Yes!  Although some positions do require horse experience, we have many other volunteer positions. Simply fill out the <a href="volunteer.php">Volunteer Form</a>, and our volunteer coordinator will get in touch with you!
